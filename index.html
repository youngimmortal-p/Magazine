            <section class="text">
                <p class="first-paragraph">The identification of the history of technology with the history of
                     humanlike species does not help in fixing a precise point for its origin, because the estimates
                      of prehistorians and anthropologists concerning the emergence of human species vary so widely.
                       Animals occasionally use natural tools such as sticks or stones, and the creatures that 
                       became human doubtless did the same for hundreds of millennia before the first giant step
                        of fashioning their own tools. Even then it was an interminable time before they put 
                        such toolmaking on a regular basis, and still more aeons passed as they arrived at the 
                        successive stages of standardizing their simple stone choppers and pounders and of 
                        manufacturing themâ€”that is, providing sites and assigning specialists to the work.
                         A degree of specialization in toolmaking was achieved by the time of the
                          Neanderthals (70,000 BCE); more-advanced tools, requiring assemblage of head and haft,
                           were produced by Cro-Magnons (perhaps as early as 35,000 BCE); while the application 
                           of mechanical principles was achieved by pottery-making Neolithic (New Stone Age; 6000 BCE)
                            and Metal Age peoples (about 3000 BCE).</p>

                            <p>For all except approximately the past 10,000 years, humans lived almost entirely in small nomadic communities dependent for survival on their skills in gathering food, hunting and fishing, and avoiding predators. It is reasonable to suppose that most of these communities developed in tropical latitudes, especially in Africa, where climatic conditions are most favourable to a creature with such poor bodily protection as humans have. It is also reasonable to suppose that tribes moved out thence into the subtropical regions and eventually into the landmass of Eurasia, although their colonization of this region must have been severely limited by the successive periods of glaciation, which rendered large parts of it inhospitable and even
                                 uninhabitable, even though humankind has shown remarkable versatility in adapting to such unfavourable conditions.
                                </p>

                                <p>Toward the end of the last ice age, some 15,000 to 20,000 years ago, a few of the communities that were most favoured by geography and climate began to make the transition from the long period of Paleolithic, or Old Stone Age, lifestyles to a more settled way of life depending on animal husbandry and agriculture. This period of transition, the Neolithic Period, or New Stone Age, led eventually to a marked rise in population, to a growth in the size of communities, and to the beginnings of town life. It is sometimes referred to as the Neolithic Revolution because the speed of technological innovation increased so greatly and human social and political organization underwent a corresponding increase in complexity. To understand the beginnings of technology, it is thus necessary to survey developments from
                                     the Old Stone Age through the New Stone Age down to the emergence of the first urban civilizations about 
                                     3000 BCE.</p>

            <section class="text text-with-images">
                <p>In the ancient world, technological knowledge was transmitted by traders, who went out in search of tin 
                    and other commodities, and by craftsmen in metal, stone, leather, and the other mediums, who passed their
                     skills to others by direct instruction or by providing models that challenged other craftsmen to copy
                      them. This transmission through intermediary contact was occurring between the ancient civilizations
                       and their neighbours to the north and west during the 2nd millennium BCE. The pace quickened in the
                        subsequent millennium, distinct new civilizations arising in Crete and Mycenae, in Troy and Carthage.
                         Finally, the introduction of the technique of working iron profoundly changed 
                    the capabilities and resources of human societies and ushered in the Classical civilizations of Greece
                     and Rome.</p>

                     <p>Though many buildings of the Greeks survive as splendid monuments to the civilized communities that built them,
                         as technological monuments they are of little significance. The Greeks adopted a form of column and lintel 
                         construction that had been used in Egypt for centuries and was derived from experience of timber construction.
                          In no major sense did Greek building constitute a technological innovation. The Romans copied the Greek style for
                           most ceremonial purposes, but in other respects they were important innovators in building technology.
                            They made extensive use of fired brick and tile as well as stone; they developed a strong cement that
                             would set under water; and they explored the architectural possibilities of the arch, the vault, and the dome. 
                             They then applied these techniques in amphitheatres, aqueducts, tunnels, bridges, walls, lighthouses,
                              and roads. Taken together,
                         these constructional works may fairly be regarded as the primary technological achievement of the
                          Romans.</p>

                          <p>Recent history is notoriously difficult to write, because of the mass of material and the problem of 
                            distinguishing the significant from the insignificant among events that have virtually the power of 
                            contemporary experience. In respect to the recent history of technology, however, one fact stands out
                             clearly: despite the immense achievements of technology by 1900, the following decades witnessed more
                              advance over a wide range of activities than the whole of previously recorded history. The airplane,
                               the rocket and interplanetary probes, electronics, atomic power, antibiotics, insecticides, and a host
                                of new materials have all been invented and developed to create an unparalleled social situation, 
                                full of possibilities and dangers, which would have been virtually unimaginable before the present
                                 century.</p>
                                 <img src="./images/technology-1850021_1280.jpg" alt="technology board" width="600" height="400" class="img-2">
                                 
                                 <p>In venturing to interpret the events of the 20th century, it will be convenient to separate the
                                     years before 1945 from those that followed. The years 1900 to 1945 were dominated by the two 
                                     World Wars, while those since 1945 were preoccupied by the need to avoid another major war.
                                      The dividing point is one of outstanding social and technological significance: the detonation
                                       of the first atomic bomb at Alamogordo, New Mexico, in July 1945.</p>
